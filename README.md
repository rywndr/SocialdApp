This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Features implemented in the smart contract

The smart contract implements a TikTok-like platform on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing users to create, like, and dislike videos. It features video creation with captions and URLs, video liking and disliking by users, tracking of user likes to prevent duplicate actions, and the ability to retrieve video information and counts.


## Overview of the different web framework and libraries used in your application and how they were used

My application is a full-stack web app built with Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and dynamic routing. I use various libraries to enhance the user interface and functionality, such as rainbowkit for connecting wallets, react-icons for adding icons, react-modal for displaying modals, ethers and wagmi for interacting with Ethereum, and javascript-time-ago and truncate-eth-address for formatting time and addresses.
